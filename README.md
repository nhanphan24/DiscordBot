# DiscordBot

After my first year at UCI, I wanted to use my Python knowledge to do something.
I decided that the "something" should be what can be used by other people. So,
I created Discord bots. There are 2 bots in total. The first one interacts in 
chat, and it takes commands from the users. It replies with information as the
users asked for.

The second bot is a music bot. It plays the song in a voice server for everyone
to hear. When a song is requested, it looks up the song on YouTube through
through YouTube-dl. If a request is sent while a song is playing, the song
gets added to a queue. The users can also pause/resume or delete song from the
queue. More information on the bots are available in their code files.

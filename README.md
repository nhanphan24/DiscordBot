# DiscordBot
Hello everyone,

This DiscordBot project was my first accomplishment outside of the classroom, so I'm excited to share it. 
I use my knowledge in Python to complete this project. I use Discord to call my friend while we play games 
together, and many of my friends use it to hold meetings as well. Because of that, I believed that it would 
be cool to have programs and can interact with us.

Therefore, I created 'happy.py', which is a chat bot that would take some requests from the users and report 
back. It can kick members, report information, and help users choose between some choices given to the bot.

The other bot that I have is 'music.py', and that one joins the voice channel of the users. It would take 
requests from the users on what song to play. It has a queue list and can add or delete songs from the queue 
list as the users want.

I think the two programs are pretty nice to have in Discord, and more information about the bots can by 
found in their file.
